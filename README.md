# Linear-Regression-in-Python
Building a linear regression model which can be applied for different datasets
## What is regression analysis
Basically regression analysis is a branch in statistical modelling that entails finding relationships between variables. The
ultimate goal in regression analysis is to understand how one variable called the dependant variable changes in response to the
changes of one or independant variables. If somehow you went through secondary or high school certainly at some point you have perfomed
a regression analysis of some sort. 

We have several models that are used so as to accomplish this and these are mentioned below:
1. Simple Linear Regression
2. Multiple Linear Regression
3. Polynomial Regression
4. Support Vector Regression
5. Decision Tree Regression
6. Random Forest Regression

Just to mention a few. Reason i trimmed down to these is that these are the only models that i will be working on here.

This repository will concentrate on the first two and seperate repositories will be created for the other models.
